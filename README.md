📘 Overview
-------------
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) or stay, 
based on various demographic and transactional features.
By leveraging machine learning, the model helps financial institutions understand customer behavior and improve retention strategies.

🧠 Objective
--------------
To build a predictive model that accurately identifies potential churners using customer data and optimizes business decisions through data-driven insights.

⚙️ Tech Stack
----------------
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier (with Hyperparameter Tuning)

🧩 Approach
--------------
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values and categorical encoding
Scaled numerical features for model efficiency
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed correlations between features and churn behavior
Visualized customer demographics and churn distribution
Model Building:
Implemented Random Forest Classifier
Performed Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize performance
Model Evaluation:
Achieved an accuracy score of 0.85
Evaluated model performance using a Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

📊 Results
------------
Model Accuracy: 85%
Algorithm Used: Random Forest (optimized with GridSearchCV)
Key Insight: The model effectively distinguishes between churn and non-churn customers, assisting banks in identifying at-risk clients early.

📈 Visualization
------------------
Below is a sample confusion matrix generated from the model:
[[2317   61]
 [ 363  259]]

🚀 Future Scope
---------------
Integrate real-time churn prediction system
Experiment with advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or Neural Networks
Deploy the model as a Flask web app for user interaction
